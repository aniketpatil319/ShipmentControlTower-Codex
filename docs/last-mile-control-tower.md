## Suggested AI/ML Models
- **Categorization & Priority Assignment:** Gradient boosted trees or rule-augmented classifiers trained on historical shipment outcomes to label buckets and priority levels.
- **Delay and Risk Prediction:** Time-series models (Prophet, LSTM, or Transformer-based sequence models) to forecast likelihood of delays or customs issues.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Clustering and anomaly detection (DBSCAN, Isolation Forest) to surface patterns causing deviations.
- **Action Recommendations:** Reinforcement learning or recommendation systems using historical resolution effectiveness.
